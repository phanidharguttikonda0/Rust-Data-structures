# Rust-Data-structures
Data structures in Rust programming

By practicing the data structures and algorithms in rust , it will strengthen the concept of ownership and borrowings in rust

It is better to practice data structures in rust that make good in rust, before going to build large scale applications

Compile : rustc FileName.rs
we will get an executable file (.exe) run the file by typing the file name in the terminal


Note : 
     Use snake case in rust for function names and the variable names mostly , as this tutorial naming
     Convention follows Camel Case , as  the peopel who practiced java, JavaScript most they will get used to
     that , but as the rust gives warning during compilation as a good rust developer follow the rust rules
